Great! We succeeded in creating a procedure that works for any color! From now on, these _small holes_ will be called **parameters**.

A procedure may not have parameters (as we have been working so far with `ComeBack` or `DrawBlackLine3`), may have one parameter (as in `Move`, `Drop` or `DrawLine3`) or may have more than one (as we will see during next exercises).
