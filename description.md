If you came so far, then you already know:

- how to write a `program`;
- how to drop and grab stones, using `Drop` and `Grab`;
- how to move the head around, using `Move` 

As you may imagine, with this 3 things, you can already solve many problems: draw the Australian flag, write your name, make a drawing of your house, etc. But sooner than later, these tools won't be enough, and your program will turn into such a complex code that you won't be able to understand it.

Don't you believe us?
Come with us to the first exercise!
